# Deployment Checklist for Sondare

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Update Before First Build

### üéØ Step 1: Get Your App Store ID

**You must complete this BEFORE building in Codemagic:**

1. Log in to **App Store Connect**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Click **"My Apps"** ‚Üí **"+"** icon ‚Üí **"New App"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Platform**: iOS
   - **Name**: Sondare
   - **Primary Language**: English (U.S.)
   - **Bundle ID**: Select `com.sondare.app` (must already be registered with your Apple Developer account)
   - **SKU**: Enter a unique identifier (e.g., `sondare-001`)
4. Click **Create**
5. In your new app, go to **App Information**
6. Find **"Apple ID"** (it's a number like `6736521843`)
7. **Copy this number** - you'll need it next

### üîß Step 2: Update Codemagic Configuration

**File**: `codemagic.yaml`
**Line 16**: Replace the placeholder App Store ID

**Find this line:**
```yaml
APP_STORE_APPLE_ID: 1234567890
```

**Replace with your actual App Store ID:**
```yaml
APP_STORE_APPLE_ID: 6736521843  # ‚Üê Your real ID from App Store Connect
```

### üìß Step 3: Update Email Notifications

**File**: `codemagic.yaml`
**Lines 79 and 112**: Replace with your actual email

**Find:**
```yaml
recipients:
  - your-email@example.com
```

**Replace with:**
```yaml
recipients:
  - your-actual-email@domain.com
```

  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## üöÄ How to Start Your First Build

### Option 1: Automatic Build (Recommended)
1. Commit your updated `codemagic.yaml` to repository
2. Push to your main branch
3. Codemagic detects the push and starts building automatically
4. Monitor progress in Codemagic dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Build
1. Go to Codemagic dashboard
2. Select your Sondare project
3. Click **"Start new build"**
4. Select **"ios-workflow"**
5. Click **"Start build"**

---

## üîÑ What Happens During the Build

The build process follows these steps:

1. ‚úÖ Install npm dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Build web app (`npm run build`)
3. ‚úÖ Install Capacitor packages
4. ‚úÖ Add iOS platform
5. ‚úÖ **Configure iOS 14.0 deployment target** (fixes CocoaPods error)
6. ‚úÖ Install CocoaPods dependencies
7. ‚úÖ Copy web assets to native iOS app
8. ‚úÖ Set up code signing with your certificates
9. ‚úÖ **Auto-increment build number** (prevents duplicate errors)
10. ‚úÖ Build IPA file
11. ‚úÖ Upload to App Store Connect
12. ‚úÖ Submit to TestFlight

---

## üéØ Build Number System (Auto-Increment)

The configuration now includes **intelligent build number management**:

### How It Works

**Scenario 1: APP_STORE_APPLE_ID Configured Correctly**
- Fetches latest build number from App Store Connect
- Auto-increments by 1
- Example: If latest is `5`, new build becomes `6`

**Scenario 2: APP_STORE_APPLE_ID Missing or Placeholder**
- Uses timestamp-based build number
- Format: `YYYYMMDDHHMM` (e.g., `202510211430`)
- Ensures every build is unique

### Why This Matters
- **No more duplicate build errors**
- **No manual build number management**
- **Works for first build and all future builds**

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå Error: "The bundle version must be higher than previously uploaded version"

**Cause**: Build number already exists in App Store Connect

**Solution**:
1. Verify `APP_STORE_APPLE_ID` in `codemagic.yaml` is your **REAL** App Store ID
2. The auto-increment script will handle it automatically
3. If it's your first build, timestamp fallback creates unique number

### ‚ùå Error: "Could not find compatible versions for pod Capacitor"

**Cause**: iOS deployment target too low for Capacitor

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Already fixed! The updated `codemagic.yaml` sets iOS 14.0 correctly

### ‚ùå Error: "Code signing failed"

**Cause**: Certificates not configured in Codemagic

**Solution**:
1. Go to Codemagic ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Code Signing
2. Upload iOS Distribution certificate
3. Upload Provisioning profile for `com.sondare.app`
4. Ensure distribution type is "App Store"

### ‚ùå Error: "While scanning a simple key... could not find expected ':'"

**Cause**: YAML syntax error in `codemagic.yaml`

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Already fixed! The heredoc issue has been resolved

---

## ‚úÖ After First Successful Build

### 1. Verify Upload to App Store Connect
1. Go to App Store Connect: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Navigate to: **My Apps** ‚Üí **Sondare** ‚Üí **TestFlight**
3. You should see status: **"Processing"** (takes 5-15 minutes)
4. Once processed: Status changes to **"Ready to Test"**
5. Build appears in TestFlight section

### 2. Add Internal Testers (Optional)
1. In TestFlight, click **"Internal Testing"**
2. Add internal testers (your team members)
3. Testers receive email invitation
4. They can install via TestFlight app on their devices

### 3. Test the Build
- Download from TestFlight on real device
- Test complete user flow:
  - Signup/login

---

## üîÅ Subsequent Builds

For every new build after the first:

1. **Make code changes** in your repository
2. **Commit and push** to main branch
3. **Codemagic builds automatically** (if configured for auto-trigger)
4. **Build number auto-increments** (no action needed)
5. **New build uploads to App Store Connect**
6. **TestFlight users notified** (if enabled)

**‚ú® Zero manual intervention required!**
